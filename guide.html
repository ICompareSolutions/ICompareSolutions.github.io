			@note Guiding Principles

			1. Every element should have a general class for the content type AND a unique ID for the specific element. This lets developers hook into things in a variety of ways to give maximum control.

			2. Each slide should have a wrapper element. Each wrapper element should have two child elements: one for the slide image, and the other for text/notes. This allows developers to style things as a single column OR side-by side.

			3. By combining nested elements with the class approach above, developers can do lots of unique things with styling, including unique layouts using CSS Grid.

			4. Don't wrap entire slides in text in a link. Instead, you can add anchor links with an icon or something designed to serve as anchors. Wrapping the whole thing in a link causes LOTS of needless narration for screen reader users.

		<!--
			@note These provide a way for folks to get anchor links to a specific slide WITHOUT announcing the entire slide text to screen reader users
			The text of the aria-hidden attribute hides the link from screen readers
